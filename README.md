# Research Projects

### Master’s Thesis Project under [Dr. Rajeev Kumar Singh](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/eee/people/rksingheee) Jan 2020 – July 2021                          
#### An Optimal Wireless Battery Charger for Electric Vehicle using EF2 Inverter 
*	Designed and simulated EF2 inverter circuit parameters for wirelessly charging the battery with CC-CV technique.
*	Designed the PI controller for an AC/DC boost converter which supplies power to EF2 inverter. The boost converter behaves as a voltage source for CC mode and a current source for CV mode.

### Rigid Body Attitude Control Project under [Dr. Shyam Kamal](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/eee/people/shyamkamaleee) July 2020 – Jan 2021 
#### Arbitrary Time Attitude Stabilization and Tracking of Rigid Body on SO(3)
*	Reformulated the attitude error dynamics of rigid body evolving on SO(3) in the form of a cascaded system.
*	Employed backstepping control, and performed Lyapunov-based stability analysis to propose a controller for attitude regulation and tracking within a specified time set by the user.  
*	Utilized continuous integral sliding mode control, to make the proposed controller robust to external disturbances
*	Validated the proposed controller through MATLAB simulations. 

### Honors Project under  [Dr. Shyam Kamal](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/eee/people/shyamkamaleee) July 2019 – Jan 2021 
#### Semi-Autonomous Stair Climbing Wheelchair 
*	Designed prototype of a semi-autonomous stair-climbing wheelchair. The prototype consists of a three-pulley track-based mechanism for climbing the stairs and a seat inclination mechanism for ensuring comfortable traversal.
*	Proposed a data-driven approach for modeling the wheelchair using sensors such as Microsoft Kinect and IMU. 
*	Designed a heading correction algorithm for safe traversal on stairs. The algorithm consists of a vision-based heading angle estimator, and a Linear Quadratic Regulator based optimal feedback controller ensuring zero heading angle throughout traversal.
*	A ROS-based architecture is implemented, and the system is tested for different staircase inclinations (upto 30°) in the Gazebo environment.

### Exploratory Project  [Dr. Shyam Kamal](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/eee/people/shyamkamaleee) Jan 2018 – April 2018 
#### Mathematical Modeling of Quadrotors
*	Studied the mathematical model of the dynamics of quadrotor.
*	Simulated the linearized model in Simulink to observe the behaviour of quadrotor on given initial conditions.
